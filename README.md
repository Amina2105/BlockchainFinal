Click-Tick is a decentralized app to manage collaborative work and store tasks. We can perform CRUD Operations with tasks there. Smart contracts handle the storage of to-do items on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Our dApp is significant as it has the following importance and values:

- Organization and Productivity
- Time Management
- Collaborative work
- Goal Achievement
- Improved Focus
- Task Prioritization

In this repository we provide Project Idea Design, UX/UI Design, Code.

### Splash Screens

The Splash screen (Figure 1) of the project, the launch screen that is first seen by the user, is purple in colour and has a tick in the box. The tick in the box symbolises a to-do list
